This application is designed to simulate the operations of an elevator within the highly classified Area 51 military base. The simulation focuses on agents utilizing the elevator to access different levels of the facility. Each agent enters the elevator to travel between floors. The simulation accounts for the security clearance of each agent. Upon arrival at a selected floor, the elevator doors will only open if the agent inside possesses the appropriate security clearance for that level. If an agent lacks the necessary clearance, they have the option to select a different floor using the elevator's control panel.
In Sequential Version, the simulation runs in a linear fashion, processing each agent and elevator movement step by step. This represents a straightforward approach, where actions occur one after another.
Contrary to the sequential model, this version introduces multithreading. Here, each agent is managed by an individual thread, and the elevator itself operates on a separate thread.
